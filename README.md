**Name of Team:** FlockShare

**Team Members:** Anjali Gupta, Nadia Lara, Janani Rao, Michelle Flores 

**Description:** Our mobile app seeks to reduce food waste at Stevens by allowing students to give and recieve food that would have been wasted. A user can upload an image or use their camera to take upload an item and corresponding users can claim those items and will recieve a confirmation QR code.  

**Technologies:** Swift, XCode, Replit, Github, Canva, PowerPoint, GenAI

**Relevant Information:** We have a corresponding slideshow presentation to discuss our ideas and thoughts behind our project.

  Title Slide:
  Good morning, everyone! We’re excited to introduce you to Flock Share, our solution to reducing food waste and tackling food insecurity on college campuses.
  
  Slide 1:
  Every year, about 60 million tons of food is wasted in the U.S., and college campuses contribute significantly to this issue. Students often purchase food but struggle to finish it before it goes bad. At the same time, many students experience food insecurity, unsure of where their next meal will come from. Flock Share was created to bridge this gap. It provides an easy way for students to share their extra food with others who need it, fostering a culture of sustainability and community support on college campuses.
  
  Slide 2:
  Flock Share is a two-part system: a mobile application and an integrated locker system designed to make food sharing seamless and accessible.
  The mobile app allows students to:
  - List extra food they no longer need by uploading a photo and description.
  
  - Browse available food posted by others nearby.
  
  - Claim food others have posted.
  
  
  The locker system ensures secure exchanges:
  - Once a food item is claimed, the donor places it in a designated locker.
  
  - The app generates a unique code for the recipient to unlock the locker.
  
  
  Slide 3:
  "For this hackathon, we focused on developing the mobile application as the core of the system. We used Xcode and Swift to build the app, integrating key features such as:"
  - GPS tracking to show available food nearby.

  - Image capture & photo library access for food listings.
  
  
  Since we only had 24 hours, we prioritized making the app functional and intuitive, laying the groundwork for future development.
  Demo:
  Now, let’s take a look at how Flock Share works in action.
  
  Slide 4:
  If Flock Share were to be fully implemented, there are a few exciting next steps:
  First, we would like to integrate the locker system to provide a secure, contactless pickup method for students to access food safely. Next, we want to implement a rewards system so every time a student shares or picks up food, they earn ducks. For every five ducks, they get $1 in DuckBills which is our campus currency. Stevens is one of the few schools without a dedicated food pantry. While Flock Share isn’t a pantry, it provides an immediate, community-driven solution to food insecurity by connecting students who have extra food with those who need it.
  
  Slide 5:
  Flock Share isn’t just about reducing food waste—it’s about building a community that looks out for one another. At the heart of it all, our goal is simple: Flock Share – A community that shares, cares. Thank you!
